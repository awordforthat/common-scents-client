# Common Scents website
The end user facing website for the Common Scents project.

## Purpose
This project is designed to fix a common problem with esoteric hobbies: product information tends to be widely scattered, unsearchable, and hard to categorize and maintain. This app is an attempt to address those problems and provide a clean, centralized interface for users to find and interact with the products they're interested in.

To start, this is built with the indie perfume community in mind, but the intent is to make it as content-agnostic as possible so that any community can use it.

## Local development
This project is built with NextJS, bootstrapped with `create-next-app`. To get started with local development:
1. Clone or fork this repo
2. From the root directory, run either `npm install` or `yarn` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the local server.
4. In a browser, go to `localhost:3000` to view the site.

That's it for now! More as development proceeds.

## Repo access
The main branch is protected and will not accept direct pushes. To submit changes, please create your own branch and submit pull rquests to have your code integrated.

## Collaboration
This is a large project with many moving pieces and I'd welcome any help you're willing to give! Contact me on Reddit (`u/awordforthat`) if you're interested - there are tasks that need doing all through the development pipeline, not just on the front end.
