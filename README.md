# Common Scents website
The end user facing website for the Common Scents project.

## Purpose
This project is designed to fix a common problem with esoteric hobbies: product information tends to be widely scattered, unsearchable, and hard to categorize and maintain. This app is an attempt to address those problems and provide a clean, centralized interface for users to find and interact with the products they're interested in.

To start, this is built with the indie perfume community in mind, but the intent is to make it as content-agnostic as possible so that any community can use it.
